# Finally got it upgraded to fabric 3, but paramiko and older versions of openssh server (which I have...)
# don't get along and the disabled_algorithms flag above needs to be present for all connections.
# The CLI interface in fabric3 is, by design, no longer the primary way to use the tool and it doesn't appear
# to be obvious how to customize the connection passed in to operate a task. (The object passed into a @task is
# a Context, based on the Invoke library's Context, not a Connection. Maybe it is possible, I just can't tell.)

# So, modify this to be what we need, then just execute this script with `python fabfile.py` instead of using `fab`.
